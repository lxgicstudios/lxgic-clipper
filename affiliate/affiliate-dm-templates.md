# LXGIC Clipper - DM Outreach Templates

For reaching out to streamers on Discord, Twitter, and Reddit. Keep it casual. You're one streamer helping another, not a salesperson.

Golden rule: if it sounds like something a brand would send, rewrite it.

## Template 1: The Genuine Recommendation (Discord/Twitter)

Hey, saw your stream the other day. You had some really solid moments that would crush on TikTok/Shorts.

I started using this AI tool that watches my streams and auto-clips the best parts, then posts them to TikTok, Shorts, Reels, and X on its own. Saved me probably 10+ hours a week on clipping alone.

Figured I'd mention it since your content would do really well on short-form. It's called LXGIC Clipper if you wanna check it out: [your link]

No pressure obviously, just something that's been working well for me.

## Template 2: The Time-Saving Angle (Discord/Twitter)

Quick question, how long do you spend clipping after streams? I used to burn like 2-3 hours per session on it.

Found this tool a few weeks ago that just does it automatically. AI watches the stream, finds the highlights, clips them, and posts to TikTok and Shorts while I'm asleep. Kinda ridiculous how much time it saves.

Here's what I've been using if you're curious: [your link]

## Template 3: The Growth Angle (Twitter/Reddit)

Yo, been following your streams for a bit. Your content is honestly underrated.

One thing that's been helping me grow is auto-posting clips to short-form platforms. I use an AI that watches my stream live and posts highlights to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Reels, and X automatically. My Shorts channel has grown more in the last month than the previous six.

Might be worth trying: [your link]

Not trying to sell you anything, I genuinely think your clips would do numbers on short-form.

## Template 4: The Casual Drop (Discord)

Has anyone here tried auto-clipping tools? I started using LXGIC Clipper a couple weeks ago and it's been posting clips from my streams to TikTok and Shorts automatically. Pretty wild honestly.

Went from posting maybe 2 clips a week to like 3-4 a day without doing anything extra. Just stream normally and it handles the rest.

Link if anyone wants to try it: [your link]

## Template 5: The Problem-Solution (Reddit/Discord)

I feel this. Used to have the same problem, great streams but zero discoverability because I never had time to clip and post.

What fixed it for me was setting up an AI auto-clipper. It watches my stream, finds the highlight moments, and posts them to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X. I literally just stream and the short-form content makes itself.

I've been using LXGIC Clipper: [your link]. Starts at $29/mo which pays for itself pretty quick if even one clip pops off.

## Outreach Tips

**Do:**
- Only DM people whose content you've actually watched. Reference something specific.
- Keep it short. Nobody reads a wall of text from a stranger.
- Be cool if they don't respond. Don't follow up more than once.
- Use Template 4 in group chats/servers. It's less direct and feels more natural.
- Wait for relevant conversations (someone complaining about clipping) and drop Template 5 as a reply.

**Don't:**
- Copy paste the exact same message to 50 people. Personalize it.
- DM someone the second they follow you. That's weird.
- Lead with the link. Lead with the value.
- Exaggerate results. Be honest about what the tool does.
- Send follow-up DMs if they don't reply. One and done.

**Best targets:**
- Streamers averaging 10-200 viewers (big enough to benefit, small enough to need help growing)
- Anyone who's talked about wanting to grow on TikTok/Shorts
- Streamers who don't currently post clips (they know they should but don't have time)
- People asking about stream growth in Discord servers or Reddit
