## Email Body

Hey,

I want to tell you about something that's completely changed how I handle stream content. Not in a "this product is amazing buy it now" way. More like a "I can't believe I was doing things the old way for so long" way.

Here's the problem I had. I'd stream for 4-6 hours, have a ton of great moments, and then never clip any of them because I was exhausted. Or I'd spend another 2 hours after stream scrubbing through VODs, cutting clips, editing them down, and uploading to TikTok and YouTube Shorts one by one. Most of the time I just didn't do it.

A couple months ago I started using LXGIC Clipper. It's an AI agent that watches your stream live, finds the best moments, clips them automatically, and then posts them directly to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X. You don't have to review them, edit them, or upload them. It just runs in the background while you stream and handles everything.

The results have been pretty ridiculous. I went from posting maybe 2 clips a week (when I had the energy) to 3-4 clips going out every single day. My short-form channels have grown more in the last month than the previous six combined. All from content I didn't have to make manually.

It's not perfect. Sometimes the AI clips a moment that's not your best work. But even then, the volume of content going out consistently is worth way more than the occasional mid clip. And the time savings alone make it worth it. I'm getting back 10-15 hours a month that I was spending on clipping.

They have three plans. Starter at $29/mo, Pro at $49/mo, and Agency at $99/mo. I'd recommend Pro for most streamers since it covers more platforms and gives you more clips.

Honestly, if you stream regularly and you're not auto-clipping yet, you're doing way more work than you need to. This is one of those tools where you set it up once and it just keeps working for you.

Let me know if you have any questions. Happy to walk you through how I set mine up.

Talk soon,
[Your name]

## Email Tips

- Send on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Open rates are highest mid-week.
- Keep the subject line lowercase if your audience is casual. It feels more personal.
- If you have screenshots of your analytics or clip performance, include one image. Visual proof converts well.
- Don't send this as your entire email. Wrap it into your regular newsletter content so it feels natural, not like a dedicated ad blast.
- Swap out the specific numbers with your own results if you have them. Real data from your own experience always converts better than generic claims.
