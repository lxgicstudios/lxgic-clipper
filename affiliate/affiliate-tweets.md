# LXGIC Clipper - Tweet Templates for Affiliates

Copy, paste, tweak to make them yours. Add your referral link at the end.

These are meant to sound like you, not like an ad. Edit them so they match how you actually talk.

## 1. Results-Based

Been using this AI clipper for my streams. It pulled 12 clips from my last session and posted them while I slept. My Shorts channel grew 400 subs this week from clips I didn't even make.

---

## 2. Pain Point

Spent 3 hours after every stream editing clips. Now I spend zero. An AI watches my stream and auto-posts the highlights to TikTok and Shorts. Should've found this months ago.

---

## 3. Curiosity Hook

My TikTok went from 200 views to 40k on a clip I didn't even know existed from my stream. AI found it, clipped it, posted it. Wild.

---

## 4. Before/After

Before: streaming 5 hours, clipping for 2 hours, posting to 1 platform.

After: streaming 5 hours, AI clips and posts to 4 platforms automatically.

Same effort, 4x the reach.

---

## 5. Casual Recommendation

If you stream and you're not using an auto-clipper yet you're leaving growth on the table. I've been using one that posts to TikTok, Shorts, Reels, and X automatically. Game changer for real.

---

## 6. Hot Take

Hot take: the streamers who blow up in 2026 won't be better at gaming. They'll be better at distribution. Auto-clipping your streams to 4 platforms is the cheat code nobody's talking about.

---

## 7. Relatable

Nobody becomes a streamer because they love video editing. Finally found something that handles the clipping and posting so I can just focus on actually streaming.

---

## 8. Specific Result

Posted 47 short-form clips last month across TikTok, Shorts, and Reels. Made exactly zero of them manually. The AI just watches my stream and handles it.

---

## 9. Question Hook

Genuine question: why are streamers still manually clipping highlights in 2026? There's an AI that watches your stream live and auto-posts the best moments to every platform.

---

## 10. Social Proof / FOMO

Found out half the streamers in my Discord are already using auto-clippers and I was still cutting clips in Premiere like it's 2019. Set one up yesterday. Already have 8 clips posted I didn't touch.

## Tips for Posting

- Add your referral link as a reply to your own tweet, not in the main tweet. Looks less like an ad.
- If you have real screenshots or analytics, attach them. Social proof crushes.
- Tweet these during peak streamer hours (afternoon/evening). That's when your audience is online.
- Don't post all 10 in a week. Space them out. One every few days keeps it natural.
- Rewrite in your own voice. These are starting points, not scripts.
