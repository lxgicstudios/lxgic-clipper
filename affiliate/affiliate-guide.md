# LXGIC Clipper Affiliate Program - Welcome Guide

Welcome to the affiliate program. Here's everything you need to start earning.

## How It Works

You get a unique referral link. When someone signs up for LXGIC Clipper through your link, you earn 25% of their subscription every single month they stay subscribed. Not just the first month. Every month. Forever.

Tracking is lifetime. If someone clicks your link today and signs up three weeks later, you still get credit. No expiration window.

## Your Commission Breakdown

| Plan | Price | Your Cut (25%) |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Starter | $29/mo | $7.25/mo |
| Pro | $49/mo | $12.25/mo |
| Agency | $99/mo | $24.75/mo |

These are recurring. As long as your referral stays subscribed, you keep getting paid.

## What That Actually Looks Like

Let's say you refer 20 people on the Pro plan over the next few months. That's $12.25 x 20 = $245/month in passive income. You don't have to do anything after the referral. No content to maintain, no support to provide. Just cash hitting your account.

Mix in a few Agency referrals and you're looking at $400-500/month without breaking a sweat.

Here's a realistic growth timeline:

- Month 1: 5 referrals (mostly Starter) = ~$40/mo
- Month 3: 15 total referrals (mix of plans) = ~$150/mo
- Month 6: 30+ referrals = $300-500/mo
- Year 1: 50+ referrals = $600-1,000/mo

These numbers compound because it's recurring. Every new referral stacks on top of what you're already earning.

## Your Referral Link

You'll get your unique link when you join the program on Whop. It looks something like:

`whop.com/lxgic-clipper/?a=YOUR_ID`

Drop this anywhere. Tweets, Discord messages, YouTube descriptions, your Twitch panels, bio links. Wherever your audience hangs out.

## What Converts Best

After watching hundreds of affiliates, here's what actually moves the needle:

**Show don't tell.** Screen recordings of the tool working beat any written pitch. Film yourself setting it up, show the clips it generates, show your TikTok analytics going up. People buy when they see it working.

**Talk about the time savings.** Every streamer knows the pain of clipping. They just finished a 6-hour stream and now they're supposed to spend another 2 hours making clips? That's the nerve to hit. LXGIC Clipper does it automatically while they sleep.

**Before/after results.** "I was posting 2 clips a week manually. Now I'm posting 3 a day automatically." Numbers like that sell themselves.

**Be honest about what it does.** Don't oversell it. It's an AI agent that watches your stream, finds the best moments, clips them, and posts them to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X. It's not magic. It's automation that saves you hours every week.

## What Doesn't Convert

- Long pitches. Nobody reads them.
- Generic "check out this tool" posts with no context.
- Pushing Agency plan on small streamers who only need Starter.
- Making it sound too good to be true.

## Where to Share

**High conversion spots:**
- Your Twitch/YouTube panels and description
- Discord servers where streamers hang out
- Twitter replies to streamers complaining about clipping
- Reddit threads about stream growth
- Your own content (TikToks, Shorts, etc.)

**Lower conversion but still worth it:**
- Bio links
- Newsletter mentions
- Stream overlay/chatbot commands

## Getting Paid

Payouts happen through Whop. You can track your referrals, earnings, and pending payouts in your affiliate dashboard. Payments are processed monthly.

## Quick Tips

1. Use the product yourself first. Authentic recommendations convert 10x better than cold pitches.
2. Don't spam. One good post beats twenty mediocre ones.
3. Target streamers who are already trying to grow on short-form platforms. They're the ones who feel the clipping pain most.
4. Answer questions honestly. If someone asks about limitations, tell them. Trust builds long-term referrals.
5. Stack your presence. Link in bio + occasional tweet + Discord mentions = steady drip of referrals without being annoying.
