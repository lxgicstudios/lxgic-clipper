## TikTok / YouTube Shorts Scripts

### 1. "I Haven't Edited a Clip in 30 Days"

Open with you sitting at your desk looking relaxed. "I used to spend 2 hours after every stream cutting clips. Haven't opened an editor in a month." Show your phone with TikTok/Shorts analytics going up. "This AI watches my stream and posts clips for me. Here's what happened to my growth." Flash the numbers. Drop the link in bio.

### 2. "Day in the Life: Streamer Who Doesn't Edit"

Morning routine, you go live, stream for a few hours, end stream, close your laptop, go do literally anything else. Meanwhile, show notifications of clips being posted to TikTok, Shorts, Reels. The hook: "While other streamers are stuck editing, I'm at the gym."

### 3. "Setting Up Auto-Clipping in 5 Minutes"

Speed-run the setup process. Screen record yourself connecting your stream, picking your platforms, and letting it run. Show the first batch of clips it generates. Quick, practical, useful content that naturally shows off the tool.

### 4. "How Many Clips Can AI Find in One Stream?"

Go live for your normal session. End stream. Check how many clips the AI pulled. React to each one. "Okay that one was actually fire." "Yeah that was mid." "Wait I didn't even remember this moment." Honest reactions make it real.

### 5. "My Short-Form Growth: Month 1 vs Month 3"

Side by side comparison of your TikTok/Shorts analytics before auto-clipping vs after. Show follower count, views, engagement. Let the numbers do the talking. Brief mention of what changed (started using an auto-clipper) without making the entire video an ad.

## YouTube Video Concepts

### 6. "I Let AI Run My Clips Channel for a Month. Here's What Happened."

Full breakdown video. Show the setup, the daily output, which clips performed well, which didn't, your analytics over 30 days. Be honest about the hits and misses. This type of transparent review content does huge numbers and builds trust.

### 7. "Streamer Workflow: How I Actually Grow on TikTok"

Broader content strategy video where auto-clipping is one piece of the puzzle. Talk about what platforms you post to, how you think about content distribution, and how automation fits into the bigger picture. More value-driven, less product-focused.

### 8. "5 Tools Every Small Streamer Needs in 2026"

Roundup video. Include 4 other tools you genuinely use (OBS plugins, chat bots, analytics tools, whatever) and include LXGIC Clipper as one of the five. This format gets search traffic and the recommendation feels natural because it's alongside other tools.

### 9. "I Tested 3 Auto-Clipping Tools. Here's the Best One."

If you've tried other solutions (manual clipping, other AI tools, hiring an editor), compare them honestly. Talk about price, quality of clips, ease of setup, and which platforms they post to. Position it as a genuine comparison, not a guaranteed winner.

### 10. "The Math Behind Auto-Clipping: Is It Worth $29-99/Month?"

Break down the actual ROI. How much time does it save? What's your time worth? How much growth did it drive? If you were paying an editor, how much would that cost vs the subscription? Streamers love this kind of practical breakdown.

## Bonus Post Ideas

### 14. "POV: Checking My Clips the Morning After a Stream"

Casual format. Screen record yourself scrolling through the clips the AI made overnight. React naturally. Works great as a recurring series, "Morning clip check" becomes a content format in itself.

### 15. "Replying to Comments About My Auto-Clipper"

Once you start posting about it, you'll get questions and comments. Screenshot them and make reply content. "Someone asked if the AI clips are actually good..." then show examples. User-generated conversation makes the best content because it answers real objections.

## General Tips for Creating This Content

- Use your real results. Nothing converts like actual screenshots and numbers from your own experience.
- Don't make every piece of content about the tool. Sprinkle it in naturally. If 1 out of every 10 posts mentions auto-clipping, that's plenty.
- The best performing content is usually the most honest. If a clip the AI made was bad, show it. If your growth was slow the first week, say so. People trust creators who don't sugarcoat things.
- Drop your referral link in bio, descriptions, and pinned comments. Don't force it into every caption.
- Repurpose across platforms. A TikTok script becomes a YouTube Short becomes a Twitter thread. Make one piece of content work three times.
