# LXGIC Clipper — Free-to-Paid Conversion Sequence

**Trigger:** Free user hits 3-clip limit during a stream
**Emails:** 3 over 5 days
**Goal:** Convert free user to Starter ($29/month)

## Email 1 — Immediate: You Hit Your Limit

**Subject:** Your stream had {{detected_count}} more highlights
**Preview text:** We caught them all. You can only see 3.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

You just hit the free plan limit. Clipper captured your top 3 moments, but your stream had {{detected_count}} more highlight-worthy clips we detected and scored.

Here's what you're missing:

- A {{game_moment_1}} that scored 89/100
- A {{game_moment_2}} that scored 84/100
- {{remaining_count}} more moments above our 72-point threshold

Those clips exist. They're processed, trimmed, and formatted. They're just locked behind the free tier wall.

Look, we built the free plan so you could test whether Clipper actually works. You've seen the results. The clips are good. The AI knows what it's doing.

Starter is $29/month. That gets you 25 clips per stream, auto-posting to TikTok, Shorts, Reels, and X, plus priority processing so clips are ready in under 5 minutes.

If your stream today was a one-off, no worries. But if you're streaming regularly and leaving 10-15 clips on the table every session, that's a lot of content that never reaches your audience.

**CTA:** Unlock All {{total_detected}} Clips — $29/month

## Email 2 — Day 2: The ROI Math

**Subject:** What clip editing actually costs you
**Preview text:** We did the math. It's not close.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Let's talk numbers for a second.

**Option 1: Do it yourself.**
Rewatching a 4-hour VOD takes about 2 hours. Trimming, formatting, and uploading 10 clips takes another 3-4 hours. That's 5-6 hours per stream. If you stream 4 times a week, you're spending 20+ hours a month on clips alone. That's a part-time job.

**Option 2: Hire someone.**
A decent freelance clip editor runs $500-2000/month depending on volume and turnaround. You also spend time reviewing, giving feedback, and waiting 24-48 hours for delivery. And they still miss moments because they don't know your content like an AI trained on 200,000+ hours of streams.

**Option 3: Clipper Starter.**
$29/month. Clips are processed during your stream and ready within minutes. 25 clips per session. Auto-posted to every platform. No reviewing. No waiting. No back-and-forth.

The gap isn't small. It's 17x cheaper than the cheapest freelancer and saves you 20+ hours a month compared to DIY.

We're not saying those other options are bad. Some creators want a human editor for polished YouTube videos. But for high-volume short-form clips that need to go out fast and consistently? This isn't a hard decision.

**CTA:** Start Starter — $29/month

## Email 3 — Day 5: Last Nudge + Discount

**Subject:** Your clips expire in 2 days
**Preview text:** 20% off your first month. This week only.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick heads up: the {{total_detected}} clips we detected from your recent streams get deleted after 7 days on the free plan. That includes the ones above your 3-clip limit that are currently locked.

After that, they're gone. We don't store free-tier overflow clips indefinitely because storage isn't free and we'd rather be honest about that than pretend otherwise.

So here's the deal. We're offering 20% off your first month of any plan this week:

- **Starter:** $29 $23.20/month (25 clips/stream, auto-posting)
- **Pro:** $49 $39.20/month (unlimited clips, multi-cam, branded overlays)
- **Growth:** $99 $79.20/month (multi-creator, agency features)

Use code **FIRSTCLIP20** at checkout.

This isn't an evergreen discount we run all the time. It expires in 48 hours, same window as your locked clips.

If Clipper isn't for you right now, totally fine. Your free plan stays active and you'll keep getting 3 clips per stream. But if you've been on the fence, this is the cheapest it'll be.
