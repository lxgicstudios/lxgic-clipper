## Email 1 — Day 0: Welcome + Quick Setup

**Subject:** Your streams deserve a clip editor
**Preview text:** Connect your first channel in under 2 minutes.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Welcome to Clipper. You just saved yourself hours of rewatching VODs.

Here's the deal: Clipper watches your livestreams in real time, finds the best moments, and turns them into ready-to-post clips. No editing. No timeline scrubbing. No hiring someone on Fiverr.

Getting started takes about 90 seconds:

1. Connect your Twitch, YouTube, or Kick channel
2. Pick your platforms (TikTok, Shorts, Reels, or X)
3. Go live like you normally would

That's it. Clipper handles the rest while you're streaming.

Your free plan gives you 3 clips per stream so you can see exactly how it works before you commit to anything.

One thing — connect your channel before your next stream so Clipper's ready when you go live. Otherwise it can't detect anything.

**CTA:** Connect Your Channel

## Email 2 — Day 3: Your First Clips Are Ready

**Subject:** Your first clips just dropped
**Preview text:** Plus 3 tips to make them hit harder.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

If you've streamed since signing up, check your dashboard. Your clips are sitting there, trimmed and formatted for each platform.

If you haven't streamed yet, this is your nudge. Connect your channel and go live. Even a 30-minute stream usually generates 4-8 clip-worthy moments.

Either way, here are 3 things that make your auto-clips perform better:

**Title your streams clearly.** Clipper uses your stream title for context. "Ranked grind" tells the AI more than "just chatting lol."

**Keep your mic levels consistent.** The AI weighs audio spikes (reactions, callouts, chat hype) heavily when scoring moments. Clean audio = better clip detection.

**Review and favorite your best clips.** Clipper learns your preferences over time. The more you rate, the sharper it gets at finding moments that match your style.

Most users see their clip quality jump noticeably after their first 3-4 streams. The AI needs a little data to dial in.

**CTA:** Check Your Clips

## Email 3 — Day 7: Case Study

**Subject:** 500 new TikTok followers in 30 days
**Preview text:** One streamer, zero editing, real numbers.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick story about a mid-size Twitch streamer who started using Clipper last month.

They were averaging 40-60 concurrent viewers. Decent community, but zero short-form content. No TikToks, no Shorts, nothing. Their growth was flat.

After connecting Clipper, here's what happened over 30 days:

- 22 streams clipped automatically
- 87 clips generated total
- 34 posted to TikTok (they picked the best ones)
- 512 new TikTok followers
- 3 TikToks broke 10K views
- Average stream viewership went from 52 to 71

The part that matters: they spent exactly 0 hours editing. They'd finish streaming, open their dashboard the next morning, pick their favorites, and hit post. Maybe 10 minutes a day.

The math is simple. Streamers who post clips consistently grow 3-4x faster than those who don't. The problem was never strategy. It was time. Nobody wants to rewatch a 6-hour VOD to find 45 seconds of gold.

That's what Clipper fixes.

## Email 4 — Day 10: Behind the Scenes

**Subject:** How the AI finds your best moments
**Preview text:** It's not random. Here's what's actually happening.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

You might be wondering how Clipper decides what's clip-worthy. Fair question. Here's the short version.

The AI analyzes 4 signals simultaneously while you stream:

**Audio intensity.** Sudden volume spikes, your reaction sounds, teammate callouts. When you yell "NO WAY" after a clutch play, that's a signal.

**Chat velocity.** If your chat explodes with messages in a 10-second window, something happened. Clipper tracks message frequency in real time.

**Game state changes.** For supported games, Clipper reads on-screen events. Kill feeds, round wins, rank changes, boss defeats. It knows when the game says something important happened.

**Visual motion patterns.** Fast camera movements, screen flashes, UI changes. These correlate strongly with high-action moments.

Each moment gets a confidence score from 0-100. Anything above 72 becomes a clip candidate. Your top moments get auto-trimmed to 15-60 seconds based on the platform you're posting to.

This isn't a generic screen recorder with random timestamps. It's trained on over 200,000 hours of gaming streams across 50+ titles.

We built this at LXGIC Studios, the same team behind 20+ open source AI tools on npm. If you want to poke around our other stuff, it's all on GitHub.

## Email 5 — Day 14: Soft Upgrade Nudge

**Subject:** You've created {{clip_count}} clips so far
**Preview text:** Here's what you're leaving on the table.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Two weeks in. You've generated {{clip_count}} clips across {{stream_count}} streams. That's real content you didn't have to edit.

But here's something you might not know: on your free plan, Clipper only captures the top 3 moments per stream. Your last stream? We detected {{detected_count}} highlight moments total. You're only seeing a fraction of what's there.

Here's what upgrading to Starter ($29/month) unlocks:

- 25 clips per stream instead of 3
- Auto-posting to all platforms (free plan is manual download only)
- Custom clip lengths (15s, 30s, 45s, 60s)
- Priority processing (clips ready in under 5 minutes)
- Clip analytics across all platforms

Pro ($49/month) adds multi-camera support, team accounts, and branded overlays. Growth ($99/month) is for agencies managing multiple creators.

Most streamers start with Starter. At $29/month, it pays for itself if even one clip drives a few new subs or followers. Compare that to a freelance clip editor at $500-2000/month, or spending 8-10 hours a week doing it yourself.

No pressure. Your free plan isn't going anywhere. But if you're serious about growing your audience through short-form, the math is pretty clear.

**CTA:** Upgrade to Starter — $29/month
