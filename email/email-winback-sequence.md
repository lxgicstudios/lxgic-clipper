## Email 1 — Day 7: Check-in

**Subject:** Haven't seen you stream lately
**Preview text:** Everything good? Quick check-in from the Clipper team.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

It's been about a week since your last stream on Clipper. Just wanted to check in.

If you're taking a break from streaming, respect. Everyone needs downtime. Clipper will be here when you're back. Nothing to do on your end. Just go live and it picks right back up.

If something went wrong with the setup, hit reply and tell us. We'll fix it. Common issues we see:

- Stream key changed and Clipper lost connection (takes 30 seconds to reconnect)
- Switched streaming platforms and forgot to update Clipper
- Clips weren't what you expected (we can adjust sensitivity settings)

If you moved to a new game, that matters too. Clipper supports 50+ titles and we're adding more every week. If your game isn't on the list, let us know. We prioritize based on user requests.

One thing worth mentioning: streamers who post clips consistently see 3-4x more audience growth than those who post in bursts. Taking a week off streaming is fine. But a week without clips on TikTok or Shorts means the algorithm forgets about you fast.

No guilt trip. Just data.

**CTA:** Reconnect Your Channel

## Email 2 — Day 14: New Features + What You Missed

**Subject:** New features dropped while you were away
**Preview text:** Plus what top creators shipped this week with Clipper.

**Body:**

Hey {{first_name}},

Two weeks is a long time in the streaming world. Here's what's new in Clipper since you last logged in:

**New this week:**

- {{feature_1}} — {{one_line_description}}
- {{feature_2}} — {{one_line_description}}
- {{feature_3}} — {{one_line_description}}

**What active Clipper users shipped this week:**

Across all creators on the platform, Clipper generated {{weekly_clips_total}} clips in the last 7 days. The top-performing clip got {{top_clip_views}} views on TikTok. Average clips per stream is up to {{avg_clips}}.

The point isn't to make you feel behind. It's that the creators posting clips right now are building audiences that compound over time. Every week without clips is a week of growth you don't get back.

Your account is still active. Your settings are saved. If you connected your channel before, it's still linked. You can literally just go live today and Clipper will start clipping again. Zero setup needed.

If you're done with streaming or Clipper isn't the right fit, no hard feelings. You can delete your account in settings. But if you're just in a rut, sometimes the move is to just hit "Start Stream" and let the AI handle the content side.

We're here if you need anything. Just reply to this email.
