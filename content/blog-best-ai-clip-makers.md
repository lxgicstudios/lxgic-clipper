Every gaming streamer has the same problem. You stream for hours. You create dozens of clip-worthy moments. And then 99% of that content disappears into a VOD that maybe 3 people will ever watch.

AI clip makers exist to fix that. But not all of them are built for gaming. Some were designed for podcasters and repurposed for streamers as an afterthought. Some detect highlights but leave you to handle everything else. And some actually deliver on the promise of hands-off clip creation.

I spent the last several months testing the five main options that gaming streamers are actually using in 2026. This isn't a sponsored listicle where everyone gets a gold star. Some of these tools are great. Some are mediocre. One barely qualifies for this list.

Here's what I found.

## What Makes a Good AI Clip Maker for Gaming?

Before comparing tools, let's agree on what matters. A clip maker for gaming streamers needs to do specific things that a generic video editor doesn't.

**Game-aware detection.** An AI that only analyzes audio volume will miss half your best moments. A quiet ace in Valorant is more clip-worthy than a loud reaction to nothing. The AI needs to understand what's happening in the game, not just how loud you are.

**Chat integration.** Your chat knows when something insane happens. A spike from 20 messages per minute to 200 is a signal that no audio-only tool can match. Tools that ignore chat data are leaving the best detection signal on the table.

**Vertical formatting.** TikTok, Shorts, and Reels all want 9:16. If the tool outputs horizontal clips, you're still editing. Real automation means the output is ready to post.

**Auto-posting.** This is where most tools stop short. They'll find the clip. They'll edit it. Then they dump it in your downloads folder and say "good luck." If you're still manually uploading to 4 platforms, you've only automated 60% of the work.

**Speed.** If clips from tonight's stream aren't ready until tomorrow afternoon, you've already missed the window. The best clips go out within hours, not days.

With those criteria in mind, here's how each tool stacks up.

## Eklipse

**Best for:** FPS streamers who don't mind manual uploading

Eklipse has been around since the early days of AI clipping. It connects to Twitch, processes your VODs after the stream ends, and identifies highlights based on game events and audio analysis.

### Pros

- Solid kill detection for shooters like Valorant, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty
- Clean, simple interface that doesn't take long to learn
- Free tier available with limited monthly clips
- Supports basic caption generation
- Template library for different clip styles

### Cons

- No auto-posting to social platforms. You download clips and upload manually.
- Detection struggles with non-FPS games. Strategy games, RPGs, and simulation titles get poor results.
- No real-time processing. Clips are generated after the stream ends, not during.
- No chat analysis. It's purely audio and game event based.
- Free tier is restrictive. You'll hit the limit fast if you stream regularly.
- Caption quality is inconsistent. You'll want to proofread before posting.

### Who should use it

Eklipse makes sense if you play mainstream FPS titles and you're okay downloading clips and posting them yourself. It removes the detection step, which is real time saved. But it doesn't handle the full pipeline.

## Opus Clip

**Best for:** Podcasters and talking-head creators, not gamers

Opus Clip blew up in 2024-2025 for its ability to turn long YouTube videos into viral shorts. The AI scoring system, which rates clips by predicted engagement, is genuinely impressive. But there's a catch for gaming streamers.

### Pros

- Best-in-class virality scoring. The AI predicts which clips will perform, and it's usually right.
- Excellent caption generation with good timing and readability
- Works with any video source, not just streams
- Good template selection for different platforms
- B-roll suggestion feature for talking content

### Cons

- Not designed for gaming content. The AI is trained on talking-head videos, interviews, and educational content.
- Processes VODs only. No real-time stream integration.
- Detects "interesting speech" moments, not gameplay moments. It'll find the part where you're explaining your build, not the part where you clutch the round.
- No game awareness whatsoever. Doesn't know the difference between a kill feed and a loading screen.
- No chat integration
- Pricing gets expensive for regular use. The $19/month starter plan has upload limits.

### Who should use it

If you're a streamer who does a lot of talking (tier lists, commentary, reactions, Just Chatting content), Opus Clip is legitimately good. If you're a gaming streamer whose best content is gameplay, look elsewhere. This tool wasn't built for you.

## Clipbot

**Best for:** Casual streamers who want basic highlights without complexity

Clipbot markets itself as an AI stream clipper for gamers. It connects to your Twitch account, runs detection after your stream, and outputs clips you can download.

### Pros

- Quick setup. Connect Twitch and start processing within minutes.
- Covers the top 20-30 most-streamed games
- Basic editing features included (trim, caption overlay)
- Lower price point for entry-level plans
- Improving detection accuracy with regular updates

### Cons

- Game support drops off a cliff outside popular titles. Niche games get poor or no detection.
- No auto-posting. Download and upload manually.
- Caption quality is below average. Timing and accuracy need manual cleanup.
- No chat analysis
- Detection accuracy is inconsistent even for supported games. Expect to review and discard 30-40% of suggested clips.
- Limited formatting options for different platforms

### Who should use it

Clipbot is a fine entry point if you play mainstream games and want something cheap and basic. Just don't expect it to replace your editing workflow entirely. You'll still be reviewing, trimming, and uploading manually.

## Medal.tv

**Best for:** Clip capture and community sharing, not AI automation

Including Medal.tv here because streamers always bring it up in these conversations. But it's important to be clear: Medal is a clip capture tool, not an AI clip maker. The distinction matters.

### Pros

- Excellent capture quality with minimal performance impact
- Works across almost every PC game
- Built-in social platform where clips get views from other gamers
- Very low barrier to entry. Install, set a hotkey, start clipping.
- Free to use for basic features
- Active community with millions of users

### Cons

- No AI detection at all. You press a button to clip. If you forget, the moment is gone.
- No editing pipeline. You capture raw clips and do everything else yourself.
- No auto-posting to external platforms. Medal wants to keep your content on Medal.
- No captions, no formatting, no aspect ratio conversion
- The social platform is nice but it's not TikTok. Your clips reach Medal users, not the broader audience you're trying to grow.

### Who should use it

Medal is great for what it is: a fast, lightweight way to capture cool moments while you play. Use it if you want to save clips for personal use or share within the Medal community. Don't use it if you're trying to build a content pipeline to TikTok and Shorts.

## LXGIC Clipper

**Best for:** Streamers who want full automation from stream to social post

Full transparency: we built this. I'm going to be just as honest about its weaknesses as its strengths.

LXGIC Clipper is an AI agent that monitors your stream in real time, detects highlights using game-aware AI and chat analysis, auto-edits clips with captions and vertical formatting, and posts directly to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X. The entire pipeline runs without manual intervention.

### Pros

- Full pipeline automation. Detection, editing, formatting, and posting all handled automatically.
- Real-time processing. Clips are identified during the stream, not hours later.
- Chat velocity and sentiment analysis. This catches moments that audio-only tools miss completely.
- Game-aware detection for FPS, battle royale, MOBA, horror, and more
- Direct posting to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X
- Scheduled drip posting so you don't dump 15 clips at once
- Caption generation built in
- Supports Twitch, YouTube, and Kick streams

### Cons

- Higher starting price than basic tools ($29/month for the starter plan)
- Newer to market. The game detection library is still expanding. Niche titles may need manual tagging.
- No free tier. There's no way to test it without committing to at least one month.
- The dashboard could use more analytics. It tells you what was clipped and posted, but deeper engagement analytics are still in development.

### Who should use it

LXGIC Clipper is built for streamers who want to stop thinking about clips entirely. You stream, the AI handles everything else. If you're tired of downloading, editing, reformatting, and uploading, this is the only tool on this list that removes all of those steps.

## Pricing Comparison (2026)

| Tool | Free Tier | Entry Plan | Mid Plan | Pro Plan | Auto-Post |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Eklipse | Yes (limited) | ~$15/mo | ~$25/mo | ~$40/mo | No |
| Opus Clip | Yes (limited) | ~$19/mo | ~$49/mo | ~$99/mo | No |
| Clipbot | Yes (limited) | ~$12/mo | ~$25/mo | N/A | No |
| Medal.tv | Yes | ~$8/mo (Premium) | N/A | N/A | No |
| LXGIC Clipper | No | $29/mo | $49/mo | $99/mo | Yes |

**Note on pricing:** Prices for Eklipse, Opus Clip, Clipbot, and Medal reflect approximate rates as of early 2026 and may vary. Check each tool's website for current pricing.

The immediate reaction is that LXGIC Clipper is the most expensive entry point. That's true. But look at the "Auto-Post" column. Every other tool on this list requires you to manually upload clips to each platform. If you value your time at even $15/hour and you're spending 10-15 hours per month on clip editing and posting, LXGIC Clipper pays for itself in the first week.

The $99/month pro plan includes unlimited streams, priority processing, all platforms, and advanced analytics. For full-time streamers doing 20+ hours per week, it's the plan that makes sense.

## Which Tool Should You Pick?

This depends entirely on where you are and what you need.

**You just started streaming and have zero budget:** Use Medal.tv to capture clips manually, then upload them yourself. It's free and gets you started.

**You stream FPS games and don't mind some manual work:** Eklipse is a solid pick. The detection is good for shooters, and the free tier lets you test it without paying.

**You do mostly talking content (Just Chatting, reactions, commentary):** Opus Clip is probably your best bet. Its AI is optimized for speech-driven content, and the virality scoring is genuinely useful.

**You want basic AI clipping on a tight budget:** Clipbot gives you entry-level detection at a low price. Just know you'll be reviewing and discarding a lot of clips.

**You want the entire pipeline automated:** LXGIC Clipper is the only option that goes from stream to social post without you touching anything. It costs more upfront, but the time savings are massive if you're streaming regularly.

## The Bigger Picture

Here's what I think most streamers get wrong about AI clip tools. They evaluate them based on detection accuracy alone. "Did the AI find the right moments?" That matters, obviously. But detection is maybe 30% of the actual work.

The other 70% is editing, formatting, captioning, and distributing. A tool with perfect detection that dumps raw clips on your desktop has only solved one-third of the problem. You're still spending hours on the rest.

The tools that will win in 2026 and beyond are the ones that handle the full pipeline. Detection is becoming a commodity. Every tool on this list will get better at finding highlights. The differentiator is what happens after the moment is detected.

Can the tool edit it? Format it? Caption it? Post it? Track how it performs? Adjust future detection based on what worked?

That's the direction this whole space is moving. And the streamers who adopt full-pipeline automation now are going to have a massive content advantage over those still downloading clips and uploading them one by one.

## Final Thoughts

There's no perfect tool for everyone. But there is a clear trend: the more of the pipeline you automate, the more content you produce, and the faster you grow. Manual clipping doesn't scale. Semi-automated clipping is better. Full automation is where the real time savings live.

If you're ready to stop editing and start growing, check out LXGIC Clipper on Whop. Plans start at $29/month, and your clips start posting themselves after your very next stream.
