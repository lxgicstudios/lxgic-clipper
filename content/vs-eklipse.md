# LXGIC Clipper vs Eklipse: Which AI Clipper is Better in 2026?

If you stream on Twitch, YouTube, or Kick, you already know the problem. You go live for 4 hours, have some incredible moments, and then... nothing happens with them. The VOD sits there. Nobody's clipping it. You're definitely not going to spend another 2 hours scrubbing through footage to find the highlights yourself.

That's where AI clipping tools come in. And right now, two names keep showing up in streamer Discord servers: Eklipse and LXGIC Clipper.

Both use AI to detect highlights in your livestreams. Both promise to save you hours of editing. But they work very differently, and depending on what you actually need, one is clearly better than the other.

I've tested both extensively. Here's the honest breakdown.

## What is Eklipse?

Eklipse has been around for a while. It's one of the original AI clipping tools, and it built a solid reputation early on by supporting over 1000 games with its highlight detection. The AI watches your stream, identifies kill streaks, clutch plays, funny reactions, and other moments worth clipping, then generates short-form clips automatically.

The free tier gives you 15 clips per stream at 720p resolution. That's actually pretty generous for a free product. If you're just starting out and want to experiment with short-form content from your streams, Eklipse is a perfectly fine place to start.

Their premium plans move to annual billing and unlock higher quality output, more clips, and some additional editing features. The detection AI is solid. It knows the difference between a triple kill in Valorant and a funny death in Elden Ring. For pure clip detection, Eklipse does a good job.

## What is LXGIC Clipper?

LXGIC Clipper takes a different approach. Instead of just detecting and generating clips, it handles the entire pipeline. Detection, editing, formatting, and posting. All of it. Fully autonomous.

You connect your Twitch, YouTube, or Kick stream. The AI watches in real-time, identifies gaming highlights using context-aware detection, generates clips optimized for each platform, and then auto-posts them directly to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X. Without you lifting a finger.

Plans start at $29/month for the Starter tier, $49/month for Pro, and $99/month for the Agency tier. Every plan outputs at 1080p or higher. There's no free tier, but there's also no step in the workflow where you need to do anything manually.

## The Core Difference

Here's what it comes down to. Eklipse detects highlights and generates clips. LXGIC Clipper detects highlights, generates clips, and distributes them across every major short-form platform automatically.

That might sound like a small difference on paper. It's not.

If you use Eklipse, you still need to download each clip, review it, upload it to TikTok, then upload it to YouTube Shorts, then upload it to Instagram Reels, then upload it to X. For each clip. After every stream. That's easily 30 to 60 minutes of manual work per session, assuming you're posting to all four platforms.

With LXGIC Clipper, your stream ends and the clips are already live. They're already formatted correctly for each platform's aspect ratio and length requirements. They're already posted with appropriate titles and hashtags. You wake up the next morning and your TikTok has 3 new clips getting views.

The time savings compound fast. If you stream 5 days a week and each post-stream upload session takes 45 minutes, that's nearly 4 hours per week you're spending on manual distribution. Over a month, that's 16 hours. Over a year, it's over 200 hours. That's time you could spend actually streaming, or just living your life.

## Where Eklipse Wins

I said I'd be honest, so here it is. Eklipse wins in a few spots.

**Free tier.** If you have zero budget, Eklipse is the obvious choice. 15 clips per stream at 720p is more than enough to test whether AI clipping works for your content. You can't beat free.

**Game library.** Eklipse explicitly supports over 1000 games with trained detection models. They've been at this for years and have built up an impressive catalog. If you play extremely niche titles, Eklipse might have specific detection patterns that newer tools haven't trained on yet.

**Annual pricing.** If you prefer paying once per year and forgetting about it, Eklipse's annual premium plan might appeal to you. Some people just prefer that billing structure.

**Low commitment.** If you stream casually, maybe once or twice a week, and you're fine with manually posting a clip or two after each session, Eklipse does the detection part well enough. Not everyone needs full automation.

## Where LXGIC Clipper Wins

**Full automation.** This is the big one. LXGIC Clipper doesn't just clip. It posts. To all platforms. Automatically. If you're serious about building a presence on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X, this is the difference between actually doing it consistently and intending to do it but falling behind because the manual work piles up.

**Output quality.** 1080p on every tier, including the $29 Starter plan. With Eklipse, you're stuck at 720p unless you pay for premium. In 2026, posting 720p content to TikTok or Reels looks noticeably worse than native content. It hurts your engagement.

**Kick support.** If you stream on Kick, LXGIC Clipper supports it natively. Eklipse doesn't. With Kick growing the way it has, this matters for a lot of streamers.

**Platform-specific optimization.** LXGIC Clipper doesn't just post the same clip everywhere. It formats each clip for the specific platform it's going to. Different aspect ratios, different length optimizations, different metadata. This is the kind of thing that sounds minor but actually affects how the algorithm treats your content.

**Consistency.** This is the sleeper advantage. The hardest part of growing on short-form platforms isn't making good content. It's posting consistently. LXGIC Clipper removes that friction entirely. Every stream generates clips. Every clip gets posted. Your accounts stay active whether you remember to post or not.

## The Real Question: What Do You Actually Need?

If you're a casual streamer who's just curious about AI clipping and doesn't want to spend money, start with Eklipse. Seriously. The free tier is fine for experimenting.

If you're trying to grow. If you want to turn your streams into a consistent short-form content machine across TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X without spending hours on manual uploads, LXGIC Clipper is the better tool. It's not even close on the automation front.

The math is pretty simple. $29/month for LXGIC Clipper's Starter plan gets you full automation, 1080p quality, and multi-platform distribution. The alternative is spending 15 to 20 hours per month manually downloading, formatting, and uploading clips yourself. If your time is worth more than about $2 an hour, the paid tool pays for itself.

## What About Clip Quality and Detection Accuracy?

Both tools do a solid job detecting highlights. Eklipse has the advantage of years of training data across a massive game library. LXGIC Clipper uses gaming-context-aware AI that understands what's actually happening in the game, not just audio spikes and chat velocity.

In my testing, detection accuracy is comparable between the two. Eklipse occasionally catches moments that LXGIC Clipper misses, and vice versa. Neither tool is perfect. You'll always have some clips that aren't great and some amazing moments that get missed. That's the current state of AI clipping in general.

Where LXGIC Clipper pulls ahead on quality is the output. 1080p minimum means your clips look sharp on every platform. And the per-platform formatting means you're not posting a weirdly cropped or letterboxed clip to TikTok because it was formatted for YouTube.

## Who Should Pick What

**Pick Eklipse if:**
- You have no budget at all
- You stream casually, once or twice a week
- You're fine with manual uploading to social platforms
- You only want clips for personal use or your own Discord
- You play very niche games and want proven detection

**Pick LXGIC Clipper if:**
- You stream regularly, 3 or more times per week
- You want to grow on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X
- You're tired of spending hours on clip distribution
- You want 1080p quality without paying for a premium tier
- You stream on Kick
- You want a fully autonomous clipping and posting workflow

## Final Verdict

Eklipse is a solid clip detection tool with a great free tier. It's been around, it works, and it's a fine starting point.

But if you're serious about turning your streams into a multi-platform content operation, LXGIC Clipper is the better tool in 2026. The full automation pipeline, from detection to posting, is what separates it from everything else on the market. You stream. It handles the rest. That's genuinely how it works.

The streaming world has enough tools that do one piece of the puzzle well. LXGIC Clipper does the whole thing.
