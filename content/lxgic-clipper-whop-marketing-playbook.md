## 1. Platform Overview & Opportunity

### Why Whop for LXGIC Clipper

Whop is the perfect marketplace for LXGIC Clipper because:

- **Clipping is already a major category on Whop.** The Discover page has "Clipping" as a standalone app category under Social Media. Whop itself runs a $190,000/month Content Rewards budget paying clippers. The audience is already there.
- **14.2M+ active users** with 6M+ monthly active users on the marketplace. This is free organic traffic.
- **No upfront costs.** Whop charges 2.7% + $0.30 per transaction. No monthly platform fees. No listing fees.
- **Built-in distribution tools:** Affiliates, Content Rewards, Chat, Courses, Forums, Discord integration.
- **The average Whop creator makes $7,382/month** (per Whop University stats).

### Key Platform Stats (Feb 2026)
- Total payouts to creators: $2.65B+
- Active users: 14.2M+
- Creators: 183K+
- Products: 198K+
- Transaction fee: 2.7% + $0.30 (one of the lowest in the industry)

### The Clipping Economy on Whop

Whop has built an entire ecosystem around content clipping:
- **Whop Clips** - Their in-house clipping rewards program
- **Content Rewards app** - Pay-per-view clipping campaigns ($1 per 1K views vs $25 for traditional ads)
- **Major creators already using it:** Sketch, TJR, Neon ($300K+ paid to clippers), MrBeast ($50K to UGC creators for Feastibles), Luke Belmar (tens of millions from Capital Club launch)

LXGIC Clipper fits perfectly here because we're selling the TOOL that automates what these clippers do manually. We're not competing with the clipping economy - we're powering it.

## 2. Whop Discover Marketplace Optimization

### How the Algorithm Works

Whop Discover rewards **traction over tenure.** The algorithm prioritizes:

| Ranking Factor | Weight | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **Conversion Rate (CVR)** | Highest | % of visitors who purchase. The #1 signal. |
| **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** | High | How compelling your thumbnail, title, and price are in search results |
| **Customer Reviews** | High | Consistent, genuine, positive reviews. Aim for 4.5+ stars |
| **Engagement/Dwell Time** | Medium | Active chat, video views, downloads inside your whop |
| **Sales Velocity** | Medium-High | Volume of sales in a short period (especially post-launch) |
| **Listing Completeness** | Medium | Using all available tools: descriptions, FAQs, rich media |

### Optimization Checklist

**Before applying to Discover:**

- [ ] Create a paid product (required)
- [ ] Get at least 1 authentic review (required), aim for 5+ in first 2 weeks
- [ ] Custom thumbnail: high-contrast, 2000x1000px

**Title Formula:** [Brand] - [What It Does] | [Platforms/Keywords]

**Description Formula:**
1. Problem: "You stream for hours but only 1% of your audience sees your best moments"
2. Solution: "LXGIC Clipper watches your entire stream, detects peak moments using AI, and auto-posts them to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Reels, and X"
3. Social proof: Numbers, testimonials, results
4. Clear CTA: "Start your 7-day free trial"

### Category Placement

## 3. Content Rewards - The #1 Growth Lever

This is the single most important marketing tool on Whop for LXGIC Clipper.

### What Are Content Rewards?

Content Rewards lets you pay creators to clip and reshare your content on a **pay-per-view basis.** You set a budget, set a rate per 1K views, and creators submit clips. You only pay for actual views.

### Why This Is Perfect for LXGIC Clipper

Think about the irony: we're a clipping tool, and we can use Whop's clipping ecosystem to market ourselves. The clippers who manually clip content are our exact target audience. By running Content Rewards campaigns:

1. Clippers see our tool while working on our campaign
2. They realize our tool does what they do manually
3. They become customers AND continue as affiliates

### Content Rewards Setup

**Step 1:** Add the Content Rewards app to your whop
**Step 2:** Create a campaign:
- **Title:** "Show How AI Auto-Clips Livestreams"
- **Content Type:** Clipping (repurpose our demo videos)
- **Category:** Software / AI Tools
- **Budget:** Start with $500 (gets you ~500K views at $1/1K)
- **Rate:** $1-2 per 1,000 views
- **Platforms:** TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, X

**Step 3:** Upload tutorial/demo content for clippers to repurpose
**Step 4:** Monitor submissions (auto-approved after 48 hours if AI flags as legit)

### Budget Recommendations

| Phase | Monthly Budget | Expected Views | Cost Per View |
|---|---|---|---|
| Launch (Month 1) | $500 | 500K+ | $0.001 |
| Growth (Month 2-3) | $1,000 | 1M+ | $0.001 |
| Scale (Month 4+) | $2,000-5,000 | 2-5M+ | $0.001 |

Compare this to:
- Facebook/Instagram ads: $25 per 1,000 views
- TikTok ads: $10 per 1,000 views
- Content Rewards: **$1 per 1,000 views** (25x cheaper than FB)
