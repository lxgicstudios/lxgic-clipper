## Script 2: "I let AI clip my Twitch stream for a week"

**Duration:** 32-42 seconds

### Hook (0-2 sec)
**Text on screen:** "I let AI clip my Twitch streams for 7 days. Here's what happened."
**Visual:** Face cam, slightly messy setup, real lighting. Not a studio. Talking directly to camera.

### Scene Breakdown

**[3-8s]** Screen recording of connecting LXGIC Clipper to Twitch channel. Voiceover: "Setup took like 3 minutes. I just linked my channel and told it what to look for. Kills, funny moments, chat going crazy."

**[8-14s]** Montage of streaming normally throughout the week. Nothing special. Just playing. Voiceover: "Then I just streamed like normal. Didn't think about clipping once."

**[14-22s]** Dashboard reveal. Numbers on screen, one at a time:
- "Streams: 5"
- "Total hours: 18"

Each number hits with a subtle sound effect. Voiceover reads them out.

**[30-38s]** Back to face cam. Voiceover: "I'm not saying this to sell you something. I'm saying this because I spent two years manually clipping VODs and hating every second of it. This just works."

**[38-42s]** Text on screen: "LXGIC Clipper - whop.com/lxgic-clipper/" Voiceover: "It's called LXGIC Clipper. I'll drop the link."

### CTA
"Check the link in bio. Plans start at $29/month. That's less than what you spend on energy drinks in a week."

## General Notes

**Posting strategy:**
- Post scripts 3 and 1 first (shortest, most hooky, best for cold audiences)
- Script 4 works great as a follow-up once people know what clipping is
- Scripts 2 and 5 are longer-form trust builders, post after initial traction
- Repost top performers with slight hook variations after 2-3 weeks

**Sound selection:**
- Always use trending sounds when possible, but keep voiceover audible
- Scripts 1, 2, and 5 need clear voiceover (original audio or text-to-speech)
- Scripts 3 and 4 can work with just trending audio + text overlays

**Cross-posting:**
- All 5 scripts work on YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels with zero changes
- For X, pull the hook + key stat as a text post with the video attached
- Script 3 works especially well as a pure text tweet without the video

**A/B testing hooks:**
- Script 1 alt hook: "My stream made me followers while I was literally unconscious"
- Script 2 alt hook: "7 days. Zero editing. Here are my numbers."
- Script 3 alt hook: "Your VODs are a goldmine and you're ignoring them"
- Script 4 alt hook: "This is what 4 hours of manual clipping looks like vs 2 minutes of AI"
- Script 5 alt hook: "Small streamers are quietly taking over TikTok. Here's the strategy."
