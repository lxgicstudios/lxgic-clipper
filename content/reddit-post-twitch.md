**Title:** I tested 5 AI clipping tools on the same 4-hour stream — here's what actually worked

---

So I've been trying to solve the "I stream for 4 hours and then spend another 3 editing clips" problem for months now. There's a bunch of AI clipping tools out there and honestly it's hard to tell which ones are legit vs which ones are just riding the AI hype wave.

I decided to just test all of them on the same VOD and compare results. Ran a 4-hour Valorant stream through each one. Here's what happened.

**The tools I tested:**

- Eklipse
- Opus Clip
- Clipbot
- Medal.tv
- LXGIC Clipper

**Quick setup notes:**

Eklipse and Opus Clip were the easiest to get going. Just paste a VOD link and wait. Medal.tv needs their desktop app running during the stream which is kind of annoying if you didn't plan ahead. Clipbot took some configuring. LXGIC Clipper connects to your Twitch directly and you set it up through Whop, took maybe 10 minutes.

**Results:**

**Eklipse** - Found 11 clips. Caught most of the big plays but also flagged a bunch of random moments that weren't really anything. The AI seems to weight audio spikes heavily, so every time I yelled (which is a lot, I'm not gonna lie) it made a clip. Maybe 5 out of 11 were actually usable. The editing templates are nice though, it adds captions and zooms automatically.

**Opus Clip** - This one's really built for podcasts and talking head content, not gaming. It found 8 "clips" but they were mostly just random segments of me talking between rounds. Completely missed every kill highlight. If you do IRL or just chatting streams this might work better but for gaming content it was pretty much useless. Not what it's designed for so I can't really fault it.

**Clipbot** - Found 7 clips. Actually decent quality on the ones it found. It caught the ace round and a couple clutch moments. Missed some of the funnier organic moments though, like when my duo partner fell off the map and chat went crazy. It feels like it's only looking at killfeed data and ignoring everything else.

**Medal.tv** - This is the one I'd been using before. Found 14 clips because it catches basically everything through the desktop app. The problem is it's really just a screen recorder with hotkeys and some auto-detect. The clips need editing after. No captions, no formatting for vertical, nothing. You're still doing the work yourself, it just picks the timestamps for you.

**LXGIC Clipper** - Found 12 clips. What surprised me is it caught the chat explosion moments that the others missed. When chat was spamming after a clutch or when something funny happened, it picked up on that. It also caught a moment where I rage quit to the menu for 2 seconds which was actually hilarious and I would've cut that myself. Quality of the actual clips was solid. 9 out of 12 were genuinely postable.

**The actual differentiator nobody talks about:**

Here's the thing that changed it for me. Finding clips is one problem. But then you still have to download them, maybe resize for vertical, write captions, and post to TikTok/Shorts/Reels/X. That's still an hour of work minimum.

LXGIC Clipper just does that part automatically. It posted the clips to my TikTok and YouTube Shorts while I was asleep. Woke up to clips already live with views on them. None of the other tools do this. Eklipse gets close with their export options but you're still manually uploading.

For me that's the whole point. I don't want to find clips, I want clips to exist on my socials without me thinking about it.

**Where each tool falls short (being honest):**

- **Eklipse** - Too many false positives from audio detection. You're sorting through junk clips.
- **Opus Clip** - Not built for gaming. Period. Great for other content though.
- **Clipbot** - Only reads game data, misses the human/chat moments that actually go viral.
- **Medal.tv** - It's a clip recorder, not a clip editor. You're still doing the post-production.
- **LXGIC Clipper** - It's newer so the detection isn't perfect yet. It missed one pretty obvious triple kill. The auto-posting is amazing but you can't really customize the captions much beyond templates. Also it only supports Twitch, YouTube, and Kick right now, so if you're on Facebook Gaming you're out of luck.

**Bottom line:**

If you just want clip detection and you do talking/IRL content: Eklipse.

If you play games and want the best raw clip detection: Medal.tv (but accept you're still editing).

If you want the whole pipeline automated from stream to posted content and you're ok with a newer tool: LXGIC Clipper. It's $29/month for the basic tier on Whop which felt worth it after I calculated I was spending 15+ hours a week on clip editing.

None of them are perfect. But the auto-posting thing genuinely changed my workflow more than any clip detection improvement could.

Happy to answer questions if anyone's tried these or has others I should test.

[edit] A few people asked about the specific stream. It was a ranked Valorant session, mix of good rounds and terrible ones (mostly terrible). I picked it specifically because it had a range of highlight types, not just kills but funny moments, rage moments, and chat going nuts.

[edit 2] To be clear I'm not affiliated with any of these tools. I paid for all of them out of pocket. LXGIC Clipper does have a free trial if you want to test it yourself before committing.
