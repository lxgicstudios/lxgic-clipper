# LXGIC Clipper — Master Marketing Plan

## Positioning
"The only AI that clips your stream AND posts it. You stream. We do the rest."

Nobody combines gaming-aware AI clipping + auto-posting to ALL platforms + fully autonomous. That's our gap.

## Execution Checklist (Ordered by Priority)

### Phase 1: Foundation (This Week)

- [ ] **Add free tier to Whop** — 3 clips/stream, 720p, watermarked "Made with LXGIC Clipper" (watermark = #1 viral loop)
- [ ] **Upload banner + logo to Whop** — Zhi manual upload (files at ~/clawd/projects/lxgic-clipper/whop/)
- [ ] **Set up Whop affiliate program** — 25% recurring commission, lifetime tracking
- [ ] **Add all Whop apps** — Chat, Forums, Files, Courses, Content Rewards
- [ ] **Build landing page** — ROI calculator (steal from Opus Clip), before/after demos, competitor comparison table
- [ ] **Record 3-5 demo videos** — real stream → AI clips → auto-posted. This is the highest converting content type
- [ ] **Create comparison pages** — "LXGIC Clipper vs Eklipse", "vs Opus Clip" (SEO gold, buyer-intent keywords)

### Phase 2: Organic Launch (Week 2-3)

- [ ] **Reddit launch** — r/Twitch, r/streaming, r/NewTubers, r/Kick (value-first posts, NOT self-promo)
  - Post: "I analyzed 500 hours of streams to find what makes clips go viral"
  - Post: "Side-by-side: AI picks vs my manual picks from same stream"
- [ ] **DM 30 micro-streamers** — free 90-day Pro access in exchange for honest review
- [ ] **Post 10 TikToks** — show AI clipping real streams in real-time
- [ ] **Join 5 streaming Discord servers** — Stream Scheme (85K members), Alpha Gaming, OBS Project, Gaming Careers, Whop
- [ ] **Launch Content Rewards campaign on Whop** — $500 budget, $1/1K views (25x cheaper than FB ads)
- [ ] **Get first 5 reviews on Whop** — needed for Discover algorithm ranking
- [ ] **Apply to Whop Discover** — once reviews are in, Discover ranks by: conversion rate > CTR > reviews > sales velocity

### Phase 3: Growth (Month 2-3)

- [ ] **Recruit 20+ micro-streamer affiliates** — free Pro + 25% recurring commission
- [ ] **Partner with 5-10 mid-tier streamers** (1K-10K viewers) — free lifetime + 30% rev share
- [ ] **Publish 2 SEO blog posts/week** targeting:
  - "auto clip twitch", "ai stream clipper", "best ai clip maker for gaming"
  - "eklipse alternative", "how to grow on tiktok as a streamer"
- [ ] **Scale Content Rewards to $1K/mo** if ROI holds
- [ ] **Start paid ads testing** ($500/channel):
  - TikTok ads (highest priority — streamers are here)
  - Reddit ads (r/Twitch targeting, cheapest CPA)
  - Google Search (highest intent: "ai twitch clipper")
- [ ] **Pitch StreamScheme, Gaming Careers** for tool roundup inclusion
- [ ] **Run first community contest** — "Best AI Clip Challenge", winner gets free month
- [ ] **Email nurture for free users** — trigger upgrade email when they hit 3-clip limit

### Phase 4: Scale (Month 4-6)

- [ ] **Scale winning ad channels** to $3-5K/mo total
- [ ] **Sponsor 1-2 streaming advice YouTubers** (Harris Heller, Gaming Careers) — $500-3K per video
- [ ] **Build Twitch extension** — organic installs, in-stream clip notifications
- [ ] **Game-specific landing pages** — /valorant-clips, /fortnite-clips, etc.
- [ ] **Monthly "Clipper Awards"** — best clips by game category
- [ ] **Open public affiliate program** with ready-made creatives + copy
- [ ] **Product Hunt launch** (as amplifier, not primary strategy)

## Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Month | Customers | MRR | Marketing Spend |
|-------|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| 1 | 22 | $878 | $1,000 |
| 2 | 51 | $2,199 | $1,500 |
| 3 | 93 | $3,757 | $2,000 |
| 4 | 142 | $5,758 | $2,500 |
| 5 | 193 | $7,897 | $3,000 |

**Year 1 target: $250-350K revenue**

## Key Insights

1. **Product Hunt is overrated** — founders report 400 upvotes → only 8 paying customers. Use for backlinks, not acquisition.
2. **Reddit converts best** — r/Twitch has active threads asking for exactly this tool. Real demos > marketing copy.
3. **Watermarked free tier is the #1 growth engine** — every clip shared = free ad. Kapwing used this to reach millions.
4. **Whop Content Rewards is 25x cheaper than FB ads** — $1/1K views vs $25/1K views. Whop spends $190K/mo on this themselves.
5. **Streamers want clips that understand gaming context** — current tools "miss the moments that matter." Our positioning.
6. **$15-19/mo is the small streamer sweet spot** — consider a $19 entry tier below the $29 Starter.
7. **Competitors' gap:** Eklipse clips but doesn't post. Clipbot posts but doesn't clip. Opus Clip does both but not gaming-aware.
8. **Two competitors shut down/acquired** (Powder.gg, Athenascope) — validates market but warns about execution.
